Issues I see:
    * Oversized docker image: run pip --no-cache-dir && apt-get --no-install-recommends
    Reduce also the number of layers stacking RUNs together.

    * Move the dirname(__file__) from `lst` binary to utils.py. Otherwise, when LST-AI is installed via pip install -e .
    A new lst file is generated in /usr/local/bin, and thus the lst binary looks for the models in /usr/bin/local, instead
    of the custom lst directory the user might have already installed the models in.

    * HD-BET call fails because hd_bet does not accept -tta and -mode args anymore. In the Readme - Installation Instructions they mention
    that a specific commit hash should be checked out prior to HD-BET installation, but the Dockerfile does not do it, leading the docker image
    to fail.
